# Array Applications & Review

This folder contains **custom implementations** and **practical applications** derived from the concepts learned in the course. These exercises focus on mastering **Arrays**, **Pointers**, and **Modular Programming** using my custom library `MyLib`.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Array Statistics Report (`01_Array_Statistics_Report.cpp`)
A comprehensive reporting tool that generates random data and performs statistical analysis.
* **Key Features:** Random generation, Count Positive/Negative, Sum/Average/Max calculations, and Search functionality.
* **Tech Focus:** Modular function calls and separating logic from presentation.

### 2. Unique Data Pipeline (`02_Unique_Data_Pipeline.cpp`)
A data processing simulation that filters and transforms user input.
* **Pipeline Flow:** `Input` -> `Filter (Distinct)` -> `Transform (Reverse)` -> `Output`.
* **Tech Focus:** Dynamic Array Simulation (using references `int&` for size) and Data Validation.

### 3. Prime Data Shuffler (`03_Prime_Data_Shuffler.cpp`)
An advanced algorithm that extracts specific data types and manipulates their order.
* **Key Features:** Extracting Prime numbers into a new array, verifying Palindromes, and implementing a custom **Shuffle Algorithm**.
* **Tech Focus:** Complex Algorithms, Swapping Logic, and Memory Management.
