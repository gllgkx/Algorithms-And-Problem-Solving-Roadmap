# Set 2: Math Algorithms & Conditional Logic (Problems 11-20)

This folder focuses on mathematical algorithms, geometric calculations, and referencing variables. It demonstrates how to translate mathematical formulas into efficient C++ code.

## Problem List

| # | Problem Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **Average Pass/Fail** | Calculates average scores and determines status. | `Enums`, Relational Operators |
| 12 | **Max of 2 Numbers** | Compares two inputs to find the maximum value. | Simple Logic, `Structs` |
| 13 | **Max of 3 Numbers** | Finds the largest value among three distinct inputs. | Nested `If-Else` |
| 14 | **Swap Numbers** | Exchanges values of two variables directly in memory. | **Pass by Reference** |
| 15 | **Rectangle Area** | Calculates the area of a rectangle. | Basic Arithmetic |
| 16 | **Rectangle Area (Diagonal)** | Calculates area using side and diagonal length. | `cmath` (`sqrt`, `pow`) |
| 17 | **Triangle Area** | Calculates the area of a triangle given base and height. | Geometry Formulas, `Structs` |
| 18 | **Circle Area** | Calculates circle area using radius. | Math Constants (`M_PI`) |
| 19 | **Circle Area (Diameter)** | Calculates circle area using diameter. | Math Logic |
| 20 | **Circle Area (Inscribed)** | Calculates area of a circle inscribed inside a square. | Geometry, Input Validation |

## Key Features
* **Pass by Reference:** Introduced in Problem 14 to modify original variable values in memory (avoiding unnecessary copying).
* **Mathematical Precision:** Extensive use of the `<cmath>` library and constants like `M_PI` for accurate geometric calculations.
* **Complex Logic:** Using nested `if-else` statements to handle multiple comparisons (Problem 13).
