# Set 1: Basics, Structures & Enums (Problems 1-10)

This folder contains the first 10 solutions, focusing on building program structure, handling data types, and using user-defined types like **Structs** and **Enums**.

## Problem List

| # | Problem Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | **Print Name** | Outputs a name to the console. | Basic Output (`cout`) |
| 02 | **Read User Name** | Reads user input including spaces. | Input Handling (`getline`) |
| 03 | **Check Odd/Even** | Determines if a number is odd or even. | `Enums`, Modulo Operator `%` |
| 04 | **Hire Driver (Basic)** | Checks hiring eligibility based on age and license. | `Structs`, Logical AND `&&` |
| 05 | **Hire Driver (Advanced)** | Adds recommendation logic to the hiring process. | Complex Logic (`||`), `Structs` |
| 06 | **Full Name** | Concatenates first and last name strings. | String Manipulation |
| 07 | **Half Number** | Calculates half of a given number. | Function Decomposition |
| 08 | **Pass/Fail Check** | Checks if a mark is passing or failing. | `Enums` (Type Safety) |
| 09 | **Sum Numbers** | Sums 3 numbers using an array container. | Intro to `Arrays` |
| 10 | **Average Marks** | Calculates the average of marks in an array. | Code Reusability, Math |

## Key Features
* **Data Grouping:** Using `Structs` (in Problem 05) to bundle related data (Age, License, Recommendation) into a single object.
* **Code Clarity:** extensive use of `Enums` for return values (e.g., `enPassFail::Pass`) instead of vague numbers like `0` or `1`.
* **Modularity:** Breaking down logic into small, reusable functions starting from Problem 07.
