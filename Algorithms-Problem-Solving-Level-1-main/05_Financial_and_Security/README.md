# Set 5: Financial Systems, Time & Security (Problems 41-50)

This folder contains the final set of Level 1 problems. These exercises focus on real-world simulations, time manipulation, and security logic using loops.

## Problem List

| # | Problem Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 41 | **Weeks and Days** | Converts hours into weeks and days. | Math, Casting |
| 42 | **Task Duration in Seconds** | Calculates total seconds from a duration (Days, Hours, Mins). | Structs, Logic |
| 43 | **Seconds to Duration** | Converts total seconds back into a readable duration format. | Modulo Operator `%` |
| 44 | **Day of Week** | Prints the day name based on user input (1-7). | `Enums` |
| 45 | **Month of Year** | Prints the month name based on user input (1-12). | `Enums`, `Switch-Case` |
| 46 | **Print A to Z** | Prints all alphabets from A to Z using a loop. | ASCII, For Loops |
| 47 | **Loan Installment Months** | Calculates how many months are needed to settle a loan. | Financial Logic |
| 48 | **Monthly Loan Installment** | Calculates the monthly payment amount based on loan duration. | Financial Logic |
| 49 | **ATM PIN Check** | Simulates an ATM login system with a PIN check. | `While` Loop |
