# Set 3: Loops & Input Validation (Problems 21-30)

This folder marks the transition from basic formulas to iterative logic. It focuses on using loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) for accumulating results, enforcing input constraints, and printing sequences.

## Problem List

| # | Problem Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | **Circle Area (Circumference)** | Calculates area along the circumference. | Math, Geometry Formulas |
| 22 | **Circle Area (Inscribed)** | Calculates circle area inscribed in an isosceles triangle. | Complex Math, `cmath` |
| 23 | **Circle Area (Arbitrary)** | Calculates circle area described around an arbitrary triangle. | `Structs`, `sqrt`, Math |
| 24 | **Validate Age Range** | Checks if an age falls within a specific valid range (Boolean check). | Relational Operators, Logic |
| 25 | **Read Age Until Valid** | Continuously asks for input until a valid age (18-45) is entered. | `Do-While` Loop, Input Validation |
| 26 | **Print 1 to N** | Prints a numerical sequence counting up from 1 to N. | `For` Loop (Increment) |
| 27 | **Print N to 1** | Prints a numerical sequence counting down from N to 1. | `For` Loop (Decrement) |
| 28 | **Sum Odd Numbers** | Sums all odd numbers within a given range 1 to N. | Loops, `If` Conditions, `Enums` |
| 29 | **Sum Even Numbers** | Sums all even numbers within a given range 1 to N. | Loops, Modulo Operator `%` |
| 30 | **Factorial Calculator** | Calculates the factorial (N!) using iterative multiplication. | `long long` (Overflow Safety), Accumulators |

## Key Features
* **Iterative Logic:** Extensive use of `for` loops for counters and accumulators.
* **Robust Validation:** Using `do-while` loops (Problem 25) to trap the user until correct data is entered.
* **Data Type Safety:** Using `long long` in Factorial (Problem 30) to prevent integer overflow with large numbers.
