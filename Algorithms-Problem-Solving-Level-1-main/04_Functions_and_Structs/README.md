# Set 4: Functions & Structures (Problems 31-40)

Transitions to building complete mini-systems using structured data, modular functions, and optimized logic.

## Problem List

| # | Problem Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | **Power of 2, 3, 4** | Calculates specific powers (square, cube, etc.) of a number. | Math, Overloading Logic |
| 32 | **Power Function** | Custom implementation of the power function using loops. | Loops, Math Logic |
| 33 | **Grade Checker** | Converts a numerical score into a letter grade (A-F). | Validation, Range Checking |
| 34 | **Commission Calculator** | Calculates sales commission based on defined percentage tiers. | Business Logic, If-Else |
| 35 | **Piggy Bank System** | Calculates total cash from mixed coin denominations. | `Structs`, Currency Math |
| 36 | **Simple Calculator** | Performs arithmetic operations based on user operation choice. | `Enums`, `Switch-Case` |
| 37 | **Sum Until Stop** | Continuously sums inputs until a specific "sentinel" value (-99) is entered. | `While` Loop, Sentinel Value |
| 38 | **Prime Check (Optimized)** | Checks for prime numbers using an efficient divisor algorithm. | Algorithms, Optimization |
| 39 | **Pay Remainder** | Calculates the change due after a cash payment. | Financial Logic |
| 40 | **Service Fee & Tax** | Computes the final bill, adding service fees and tax percentages. | Constants, Math |

## Key Features
* **Structured Data:** Extensive use of `structs` to manage related data (e.g., Piggy Bank coins).
* **Code Clarity:** Using `Enums` for operation choices and status checks to avoid "Magic Numbers".
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Implemented efficient Prime Checking logic (Looping until `Number/2` or `sqrt`) to reduce processing time.
