Welcome to my **Master Repository** for Algorithms and Problem Solving.
This repository documents my journey through the **Programming Advices Roadmap**, focusing on building a strong foundation in Computer Science, Logic, and Memory Management using **C++**.

The repository is structured into **Levels**, where each level represents a significant leap in complexity and architectural understanding.

## Roadmap Progress (Current Status)

| Level | Focus Area | Language | Key Skills Acquired | Status |
|:---:|---|:---:|---|:---:|
| **01** | **Foundations & Logic Building** | C++ | `Basics`, `Control Flow`, `Tracing`, `Problem Solving Strategies` | ✅ Completed |
| **02** | **Modular Programming & Algorithms** | C++ | `Functions`, `Library Building`, `Memory Management`, `Math Algorithms` | ✅ Completed |

## Level Overview

### 1️⃣ Level 1: Foundations
**Directory:** [`./01_Level_1_Basics`](./01_Level_1_Basics)
The starting point of the journey. This level focuses on raw logic building, understanding syntax, and solving fundamental problems (1 to 50) using basic control structures without relying on advanced libraries.

### 2️⃣ Level 2: Modular Programming
**Directory:** [`./02_Level_2_Modular_Programming`](./02_Level_2_Modular_Programming)
The shift from writing code to **architecting software**. This level introduces:
* **Modular Design:** Breaking code into header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files.
* **Custom Libraries:** Building a reusable utility library (`MyLib`) from scratch.
* **Algorithms:** Implementing mathematical and array-based algorithms manually.
* **Capstone Projects:** Building complete mini-systems (Games & Tools).

---

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++ (ISO Standard).
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Community.
* **Key Concepts:** Structural Programming, Modular Architecture, Memory Management.
